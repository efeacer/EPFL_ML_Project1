## Higgs Boson Classification Using Regression Techniques

First project of the EPFL Machine Learning course, which aims to solve the Higgs Boson classification 
problem (https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson) using regression techniques. The given report 
explains our machine learning procedure in detail and the python code in the Scripts folder is 
well documented.
